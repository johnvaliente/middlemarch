             <p> Rosamond Vincy is the daughter of Walter Vincy and Lucy Vincy. Fred Vincy is her brother. Rosamond is described to be really beautiful. She was looking for a man that was not from Middlemarch and met Lydgate who stood out of her other other admirers because of his profession and good birth, “it was part of Rosamond’s cleverness to discern very subtly the faintest aroma of rank” (p.159). Rosamond envied Dorothea Brooke’s marriage with Edward Casaubon, “she envied them, notwithstanding their plain dress.” (p.159).</p>              
               
            </br>
            <p> Rosamond and Lydgate get married, and more problems ensue. She had a spending habit that would eventually put her and Lydgate in debt. She is characterized as stubborn, selfish, and did not cooperate with Lydgate. An example of her stubbornness is seen in chapter 64, when Rosamond went behind Lydgate’s back to prevent selling their house with her reason being, “I knew that it would be very injurious to you if it were known that you wished to be part with your house and furniture, and I had a very strong objection to it.” (p.619). </p>
            </br>
            <p> When the controversy with that occurred with Lydgate and Bulstrode, the people of Middlemarch felt bad for Mrs. Bulstrode but not Rosamond, “Rosamond was more criticized and less pitied” (p.698). Rosamond’s neighbours ill-feelings towards her during this controversy suggests Rosamond’s character. After Lydgate passes away Rosamond remarries an older man calling her second marriage to be her “reward” (p.782). </p>

            <p> Dorothea Brooke is one of the main characters in Middlemarch. She has strong determination, religious, smart, and has natural beauty without having to wear extravagant clothes. She is relentless in getting the things that she wants in her life. The early part of the book showed Dorothea being courted by two men, Sir James Chettam, and Edward Casaubon. Dorothea thinks of Sir James as a puppy and that he is perfect for her sister Celia Brooke. In chapter 2, “Dorothea said to herself that Mr. Casaubon was the most interesting man she had ever seen” (p.16). </p>
            </br>
            <p> The middle part of the book details Casaubon and Dorothea’s marriage. The first month of their marriage, during their honeymoon, Dorothea found herself upset with Causabon, “All those rows of volumes-will you not now do what you used to speak of? Will you not make up your mind what part of them you will use, and begin to write the book which will make your vast knowledge useful to the world?” (p.191) This tense argument early on in their marriage is a clear sign of their conflicting views. </p>
            </br>
            <p> Will Ladislaw’s character slowly gets involved in Dorothea’s life when he first saw her crying in Rome. Will Ladislaw started to fall in love with her and Casaubon was sensing it. Casaubon would then proceed to prevent Dorothea from speaking to Ladislaw and later added to his Last Will that if Dorothea marries Will Ladislaw when he passes, all the money she receives from his death will be revoked. </p>
            </br>
            <p> Dorothea’s character shows when she decides to help Lydgate clear his loans because she truly believed that Lydgate is innocent. The book ends with Dorothea giving up her possessions and getting married to Will. “They were bound to each other by a love stronger than any impulses which could have marred it.” (p.782).</p>

                <p> Edward Casaubon is described to be an older man who has not married. He comes from a wealthy family and lives in an estate he had inherited called Lowick. In chapter 6, Sir James describes Casaubon best, “Good God! It is horrible! He is not better than a mummy!” (p.55). </p>
            </br>
            <p> Leading up to his wedding Casaubon did not seem excited at all. In chapter 10, it describes Casaubon’s feeling about his wedding coming up, “Poor Mr. Casaubon had imagined that his long, studious bachelorhood had stored up for him a compound interest of enjoyment and that large drafts on his affections would not fail to be honoured; for we all of us, grave or light, get our thoughts entangled in metaphors and act fatally on the strength of them. And now he was in danger of being saddened by the very conviction that his circumstances were unusually happy” (p.81). </p>
            </br>
            <p> Casaubon has this book that he has working on for most of his life and was never to be completed. In chapter 22, Will exposes that Casaubon’s work can be deemed meaningless, “that the Germans have taken the lead in historical inquiries, and they laugh at the results which are got by groping about in woods with a pocket-compass while they have made good roads.” (p.199). </p>
            </br>
            <p> We find out that Casaubon should not be deserving of all the wealth that he has inherited. Casaubon’s aunt Julia, Casaubon’s mother’s sister was disowned for running away which resulted in Casaubon’s family receiving all of the family’s inheritance. Towards the end of his life, Casaubon grew jealous of the thought of Will and Dorothea marrying when he passes away that he adds to his last will that Dorothea will lose all of the money she receives from his passing if she marries Will Ladislaw. </p>

                <p> Will Ladislaw is Edward Casaubon’s cousin. He was first introduced to readers when Dorothea and her family were visiting Lowick. Ladislaw comes across as someone whose behavior or views do not conform to common ideas and practices, “Doubtless; but I fear that my young relative Will Ladislaw is chiefly determined in his aversion to these callings by a dislike to steady application and to that kind of acquirement which is needful instrumentally but is not charming or immediately inviting to self-indulgent taste.” (p.77). </p>
            </br>
            <p> Will’s family had been unlucky with receiving family fortunes both from his mother’s side and father’s side. When looking at Will’s family from his father’s side, his grandmother, who is Edward Casaubon’s aunt, was disowned by her family because she married someone that they did not like. This meant that Will’s grandmother did not receive any family fortunes and they were all given to Edward Casaubon’s family, Dorothea’s husband. </p>
            </br>
            <p>  On Will’s mother side, Sarah Dunkirk had run away from her family business after finding out that the family business was illegal. Raffles tells Will about why his mother had ran away in chapter 60, “Lord bless you, I knew all about ‘em -a little in what you may call the respectable thieving line-the high style of receiving-house-none of your holes and corners-first-rate. Sarah would have known nothing about it.” (p.573). After Sarah’s father (Will’s grandfather) had died, she did not receive inheritance because of Bulstrode.  </p>
            </br>
            <p> Throughout the book we see Will’s love for Dorothea grow stronger. From Casaubon prohibiting Will from going to Lowick to finding out about Casaubon’s last will, Dorothea and Will went through many challenges in their relationship. A sweet interaction between them in chapter 54 occurred before Will left Middlemarch, “It had seem to him as if they were like two creatures slowly turning to marble in each other’s presence, while their hearts were conscious and their eyes were yearning.” (p.511). At the end of the story, Will ends up marring Dorothea and he becomes a political figure and a Member of Parliament. </p>

                <p> Tertius Lydgate is introduced to the readers as the new Doctor in Middlemarch. He is a very ambitious doctor that wants to create a positive impact in the world. “Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific, rational basis of profession.” (p.141). On page 142, he was described to be a young doctor at the age of 27 “without any fixed vices, with a generous resolution that his action should be beneficent, and with ideas in his brain that made life interesting” (p.142). He threw himself in his work and was very proud to be a doctor, “Lydgate felt a triumphant delight in his studies and something like pity for those less lucky men who were not of his profession” (p.158). </p>
            </br>
            <p> In his profession, he struggled to gain the trust of the people of Middlemarch because of his close business relations to Bulstrode, “But the consequence is, that the whole profession in Middlemarch has set themselves tooth and nail against the Hospital, and not only refuse to co-operate themselves, but try to blacken the whole affair and hinder subscriptions.” (p.413). This last quote is Lydgate speaking on his frustrations about how everyone in Middlemarch is against him and his new ideas simply because of people’s animosity against Bulstrode. </p>
            </br>
            <p> Lydgate married a beautiful girl in Rosamond, but this ultimately led to many hardships in his life. He was in debt and needed $1000. He asked help from everyone but was rejected until Bulstrode gave him a loan. However, Lydgate was involved in a big controversy when Raffles died. Dorothea was the only person that believed in Lydgate and his work that she offered to pay off all his debts. Despite being debt free, Rosamond and Lydgate moved to London and he became a highly credible doctor. “He had gained an excellent practice, alternating, according, according to the season, between London and a Continental bathing-place, having written a treatise on gout, a disease which has a good deal of wealth on its side. His skill was relied on by many paying patients, but he always regarded himself as a failure: he had not done what he once meant to do.” (p.781). Lydgate died at the young age of 50 years old. </p>

                <p> Fred is the son of Walter Vincy and Lucy Vincy, and Rosamond is his sister. Fred comes off as someone who does not understand the consequences of his actions. An example is his gambling habits that led him to his debt. Fred hoped that he would be receiving a lot of money from Featherstone but ended up only receiving $100.  He is unable to pay his debts to Mr. Bambridge which unfortunately affects the Garth family because Caleb Garth co-signed this loan. </p>
            </br>
            <p> Readers got a sense of Fred’s true character because of the way he had admitted to his errors and broke the news to Mr. and Mrs. Garth personally, “I am come to tell you something that I am afraid will give you a bad opinion of me. I am come to tell you and Mrs. Garth that I can’t keep my word. I can’t find the money to meet the bill after all. I have been unfortunate; I have only got these fifty pounds towards the hundred and sixty.” (p.236). He also personally told Mary, who he loves deeply, about his inability to pay his debt in time, “I asked your father to put his name to a bill. I thought it would not signify to him. I made sure of paying his name to a bill. I thought it would not signify to him. I made sure of paying the money myself, and I have tried as hard as I could.” (p.241). </p>
            </br>
            <p> Fred refuses to obey his father’s wishes in becoming a clergyman because he knew that Mary would not marry him and ends up enjoying his work under Mr. Garth in his office. Fred ends marrying Mary Garth, who was his childhood crush since they were young. They had 3 boys and he “became rather distinguished in his side of the county as a theoretic and practical farmer” (p.779). </p>

                <p> Nicholas Bulstrode is introduced to readers as an affluent banker. He claims to be a religious man but is really a hypocrite. In an effort to try and get Bulstrode to write a note to Featherstone, Mr. Vincy had this to say to say to Bulstrode, “You like to be master, there’s no denying that; you must be first chop in heaven, else you won’t like it much” (p.124). Bulstrode makes it a point to show everyone how deeply religious he is. Not many people trust Bulstrode because he was not born in Middlemarch. Although he funded the Fever Hospital, which promotes the improvement in the field of medicine through medical reform. </p>
            </br>
           <p> Bulstrode had to face his sketchy past in chapter 53 when he sees John Raffles. Raffles torments Bulstrode about what he had done, “Why, if a man has got any heart, doesn’t he want to see an old friend, Nick? I must call you Nick – we always did call you young Nick when we knew you meant to marry the old widow.” (p.496). We learn that Bulstrode married a rich widow named Mrs. Dunkirk. The reason why Bulstrode had received his wealth is because he hid Mrs. Dunkirk’s daughter, Sarah Dunkirk, so that he would receive all the riches and not have to give any to Sarah. </p>
           </br>
           <p> Bulstrode’s frustration towards Raffles caused Raffles’ death, by allowing him to drink alcohol when he was not supposed to. This caused a major controversy in Middlemarch as rumours spread about what Bulstrode had done. Before he and his wife Mrs. Bulstrode left Middlemarch, Mrs. Bulstrode makes a deal with Caleb Garth to help Fred Vincy work for Garth. </p>
